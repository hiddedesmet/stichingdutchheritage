# Required Images for Stitching Dutch Heritage Website

## Logo Images (Required)
You need to create and add these logo files to the `images/` folder:

1. **dutch-heritage-logo-nl.png** - Dutch version of your logo
2. **dutch-heritage-logo-en.png** - English version of your logo  
3. **folkloredag-logo.png** - Logo for the Folkloredag event

## Logo Specifications
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Size**: Approximately 200-300px wide, 50-80px tall for optimal display
- **Style**: Should match the heritage theme with Dutch traditional elements

## Existing Embroidery Images
Your existing JPEG images (1.JPEG through 45.JPEG) will be used in the gallery. The website is already configured to display these images.

## Logo Design Suggestions

### Dutch Heritage Logo (NL version)
- Include traditional Dutch elements like windmills, tulips, or traditional patterns
- Use colors that reflect Dutch heritage (greens, blues, traditional embroidery colors)
- Text: "Stitching Dutch Heritage" in Dutch styling

### English Logo
- Same visual elements as Dutch version
- Possibly with "English" or international styling elements
- Ensure it clearly represents the English version of the site

### Folkloredag Logo
- Should link to the official Folkloredag website
- If you have the official logo, use that
- Otherwise, create one that represents the folk heritage theme

## Image Optimization
- Compress images for web use
- Ensure logos are crisp at different screen sizes
- Test on both light and dark backgrounds if needed

## Alternative Solution
If you don't have separate Dutch/English logos yet, you can:
1. Use the same logo for both languages initially
2. Update the JavaScript to not switch logos:
   ```javascript
   // Comment out or remove the logo switching code in main.js
   ```
